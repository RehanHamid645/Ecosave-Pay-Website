# Why UK Energy Supplier Customer Service Has Declined (and How Brokers Help)

Over the past couple of years, UK energy suppliers have faced a perfect storm of challenges — and customer service has taken a hit. While some suppliers have made improvements recently, many businesses still report long wait times, unresolved issues, and a lack of support when they need it most.

At **Ecosave Gas and Power**, we believe you deserve better. Here’s what’s really going on — and how we help you avoid the hassle.

## 🔄 1. The Market Is Still Recovering

The energy crisis of 2021–2023 led to the collapse of dozens of suppliers. Those that survived had to absorb millions of new customers almost overnight. Even now, in 2025, many are still playing catch-up, especially when it comes to service infrastructure.

## 👥 2. Staffing Shortages & High Turnover

Recruiting and retaining skilled customer service staff remains a major challenge. Some suppliers are still relying on undertrained or outsourced teams, leading to inconsistent service and longer resolution times.

## 🖥️ 3. Tech Gaps Are Holding Suppliers Back

While some suppliers have invested in digital tools, others are still using outdated systems. This creates delays, disjointed communication, and frustration — especially when switching or resolving billing issues.

## 📊 4. Mixed Performance Across the Board

According to **Citizens Advice**, customer service scores vary widely. In **June 2025**:

- **Crown Gas and Power**, **Ecotricity**, and **Eon Next** ranked highest for service  
- **Maxen Power**, **Engie**, and **SSE** were among the lowest-rated

Even top suppliers aren’t perfect — so choosing the right one matters more than ever.

## 📈 5. Expectations Are Higher Than Ever

Today’s customers expect fast, personalised service, especially in a digital-first world. When suppliers fall short, it’s not just frustrating — it can cost your business time and money.
