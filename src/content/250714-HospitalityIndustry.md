# Hospitality Industry Energy Costs: How UK Restaurants and hotels can Save in 2025

From restaurants and hotels to pubs, cafés, and event venues, the UK’s hospitality sector is under pressure.  
And one of the biggest challenges? **Managing energy costs.**

At **Ecosave Gas and Power**, we understand the unique energy struggles hospitality businesses face – and we’re here to help you take control.

## 🔥 Why Energy Is a Major Pain Point for Hospitality

Hospitality businesses are energy-intensive by nature. You rely on:

- Heating and cooling systems to keep guests comfortable  
- Kitchen equipment running all day  
- Lighting that creates the perfect atmosphere  
- Refrigeration that never sleeps  

And with long opening hours and seasonal peaks, energy usage can be **unpredictable – and expensive**.

## 📉 The Challenges You’re Up Against

1. **Volatile Energy Prices**  
   The energy market has been unstable for years. Many hospitality businesses are still recovering from the price surges of 2022–2023.

2. **Complex Contracts**  
   Multiple meters, variable usage, and unclear billing often lead to contracts that don’t reflect your actual needs.

3. **Cash Flow Pressures**  
   Margins in hospitality are tight. Overpaying for energy can quickly eat into your profits.

4. **Lack of Time**  
   You’re focused on service, staffing, and customer experience – not chasing energy suppliers or comparing tariffs.

## 🚫 Supplier Restrictions: The Hidden Barrier

Here’s something many hospitality businesses don’t realise until it’s too late:

- Some energy suppliers **refuse to offer contracts** to hospitality businesses altogether – especially pubs, takeaways, or late-night venues.  
- Others impose **strict credit score requirements**, making it difficult for newer or recovering businesses to secure a deal.  
- In some cases, suppliers demand **hefty deposits or shorter contract terms**, which can limit your options and increase your costs.

This makes it even more important to have someone in your corner who **knows the market** – and who can find suppliers willing to work with you.
