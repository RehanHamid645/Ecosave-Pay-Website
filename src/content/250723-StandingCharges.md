# What are Standing Charges on Business Energy Bills? (UK Guide 2025)

If you’ve ever looked at your energy bill and thought, “What’s this daily charge even for?” — you’re not alone.  
At **Ecosave Gas and Power**, we believe in cutting through the jargon and helping UK businesses understand exactly what they’re paying for — and how to pay less!

Let’s talk about **standing charges** — what they are, why they exist, and how they affect your bottom line.

## 📌 What Is a Standing Charge?

A **standing charge** is a fixed daily fee you pay just for being connected to the energy network. It’s there whether you use 1 kWh or 10,000.  

Think of it like a **line rental** for your gas and electricity — it keeps the supply flowing to your premises.

But here’s the thing: **not all standing charges are created equal.**  
And that’s where the savings opportunity lies.

## 🧾 What Does the Standing Charge Actually Cover?

Your standing charge helps cover:

- 🔧 **Metering & Infrastructure**  
  The cost of installing, maintaining, and upgrading your energy meters and the network that powers your business.

- 📞 **Operational Overheads**  
  Billing, customer service, account management — everything your supplier does to keep your energy account running.

- 🔌 **Network Distribution Fees**  
  Payments to the companies that maintain the UK’s gas and electricity networks — so energy gets from the source to your site.

- 🌍 **Environmental Levies**  
  Contributions to government schemes that support renewable energy and energy efficiency.

## ⚖️ Why It Matters to Your Business

Some suppliers offer **low unit rates but high standing charges.** Others flip the script.  
The right deal depends on **how your business uses energy**.

- If you’re a **high-usage** business, a lower unit rate might save you more.
- If your usage is **low or seasonal**, a lower standing charge could be the smarter move.

That’s why we **don’t just compare prices — we compare strategies**.
