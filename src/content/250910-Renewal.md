# When should your business renew its' energy contract?

Renewing your business energy contract might not be at the top of your to do list, but leaving it until the last minute can be an expensive mistake. In the UK’s fast changing energy market, prices can shift overnight, leaving businesses exposed to higher costs.
The good news? Timing your renewal correctly could save your company thousands of pounds each year. Here’s what every business owner should know about contract renewals in 2025.

## Why Timing matters in the UK Energy Market?
The UK energy market is known for its volatility. Prices move up and down based on factors such as:
Seasonal demand (heating in winter, cooling in summer)


• Global supply and demand


• Political and economic uncertainty


• Wholesale market swings (sometimes by as much as 10% in a single day)


Because of this, renewing at the wrong time could mean locking into a higher rate than necessary. Renewing at the right time, however, can help you secure lower prices and give you peace of mind.


## When should businesses start renewing?
A good rule of thumb is to review your options six to nine months before your contract ends.
For smaller businesses, six months is usually enough.


For larger companies or those with complex energy needs, starting earlier is recommended.


This proactive approach gives you more flexibility and time to compare deals, instead of rushing decisions at the last minute.



## Benefits of renewing early
Renewing your business energy contract ahead of time comes with a number of advantages:

### Competitive rates
Suppliers often reward early planning with better prices.


### Less stress 
No last minute scrambling before contracts end.


### Budget certainty
Fixed rates allow you to plan your costs more effectively.


### Stronger negotiating position 
You’re not tied down by time pressure, so you can shop around freely.

## The Risk of Doing Nothing
If you don’t act before your contract expires, your account may roll onto a default or deemed rate tariff. These are usually the most expensive tariffs available and can significantly increase your bills. Many businesses only realise this after they’ve already overpaid.
