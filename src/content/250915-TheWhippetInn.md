# The Whippet Inn – Switching Business Energy Supplier
The Whippet Inn is a long standing hospitality business that needed support in managing their business energy contract.

## The Problem
The Whippet Inn had been stuck with EDF for months after taking over a new tenancy. EDF refused to release them from their energy contract due to an outstanding balance from previous tenants, a common problem many UK businesses face during a change of tenancy.

## Our Solution
Our team took ownership of the case and worked directly with EDF to resolve the dispute. Once cleared, we were able to switch The Whippet Inn to a new business energy contract with Yu Energy.

## Now, the business has:
-	Peace of mind knowing the contract issue is resolved
-	Stability with a new supplier
-	A competitive energy rate locked in

If your business is facing problems switching energy suppliers, don’t wait.
