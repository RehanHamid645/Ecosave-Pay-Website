# Roger - Part owner of a large farm partnership

## The Problem

Roger, the part owner of a large farm partnership, was struggling with his domestic energy contracts. Closing down meters and dealing with suppliers can often be confusing and time consuming, especially when it comes to making sure accounts are properly finalised and no unexpected charges appear.

## The Solution


Ecosave Gas and Power stepped in to manage the process on the owners’ behalf. Our team worked directly with the suppliers to ensure his domestic meters were closed down correctly and that everything was handled smoothly. By taking ownership of the admin, we removed the stress and gave Roger peace of mind that the contracts were being dealt with properly.


## The Result

Roger was extremely happy with the support he received, telling us how pleased he was with the way Ecosave Gas and Power handled everything. With his contracts now closed successfully, he can focus fully on running his business, knowing his energy accounts are in safe hands.

### “EcoSave took a huge weight off my shoulders. I was dreading the hassle of closing down my domestic energy accounts, but they handled everything, from dealing with suppliers to making sure no surprise charges popped up. I couldn’t be happier with the support. I’d recommend them to everyone as it’s a lot more stress free speaking to the broker than directly to the supplier.” 
 Roger, Farm Partnership Owner

● Fixed energy plan

● No surprise costs
