# Does Moving Properties Affect My Business Energy Contract?

Relocating your business can be exciting, but it also brings a long list of things to think about. One of the most commonly overlooked is your business energy contract. So, does moving locations affect it? The short answer is yes, and understanding how can save your business from unnecessary costs or disruptions.

## What Happens to Your Energy Contract When You Move

When you move into a new business property, your existing energy contract doesn’t automatically move with you. Energy contracts are linked to the property’s meter and supply point, not the business itself.

### This means:

· Your old contract ends if you let the supplier know you'll be leaving the premises (on the date you give)

· You’ll usually need to set up a new contract for your new address.

· If you don’t choose a new supplier straight away, you could be placed on a deemed or out-of-contract rate, which is often much higher.

That’s why it’s important to act quickly when planning your move.


## What You Need to Do Before Moving

### To make the transition smooth and avoid paying more than you should, follow these steps:

1. Contact your current supplier: Let them know about your move as early as possible (ideally 30 days’ notice).

2. Take a final meter reading: On your last day, take a photo of your meter reading to make sure you’re billed correctly.

3. Provide your new address: This ensures your final bill and any correspondence go to the right place.

4. Arrange a new contract for your new site: Compare business energy quotes before moving in to secure the best rate.


## What to Expect at Your New Business Location

When you move into your new premises, you’ll automatically inherit the previous tenant’s energy supplier. Until you arrange your own contract, you’ll be charged deemed rates, which can be up to 80% more expensive than a fixed-rate plan.

That’s why it’s crucial to contact a trusted energy consultancy like Ecosave Gas & Power as soon as possible. We’ll help identify your new supplier, compare quotes from across the market, and set you up on the right deal quickly — saving you both time and money.
