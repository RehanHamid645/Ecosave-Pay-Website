# Mr Black - Farming group

## The Problem

Mr Black was moved to a new supplier but faced several issues. He never received a welcome pack, and no engineer was sent to install the required smart meter. Despite this being the supplier’s responsibility, the new supplier began threatening price increases because the meter hadn’t been fitted.

## Our Solution

Ecosave Gas and Power stepped in to manage the situation on Mr Black’s behalf. We dealt directly with the new supplier, challenged the unfair threats, and ensured the client was not penalised for the supplier’s error. Our team worked to get the contract back on track and resolve the smart meter issue.

## Now, the business has:

● Stable energy contract

● No longer faces unnecessary price increases

● Peace of mind

## “I was completely stuck, no welcome pack, no smart meter, and then they started threatening price hikes. EcoSave stepped in and handled everything. They challenged the supplier, sorted the contract, and made sure I wasn’t penalised for something that wasn’t my fault. I finally feel like my energy is under control.”
