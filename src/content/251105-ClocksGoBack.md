#  How does the clocks going back an hour affect your business?

Every October, the UK clocks go back one hour, marking the end of British Summer Time. While it means brighter mornings, it also brings darker evenings, colder weather, and higher energy use for businesses across the country. For many small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), this seasonal change can have a big impact on gas and electricity bills.

At Ecosave Gas & Power, we help businesses prepare for these shifts and keep costs under control. Here are some simple ways to save energy as we move into the winter months:

## 1\. Adjust Heating Schedules

When the clocks change, make sure your heating timers and smart thermostats are updated. Running heating an extra hour by mistake can waste energy and increase bills unnecessarily.

## 2\. Maximise Natural Light

With shorter days, it’s tempting to keep the lights on longer. Encourage staff to use natural daylight where possible, and switch to **LED lighting** to cut costs by up to 80% compared to traditional bulbs.

## 3\. Review Your Energy Contract

Seasonal changes are a good reminder to check whether you’re on the best energy deal. Many businesses overpay without realising it. Ecosave compares tariffs from leading **UK energy suppliers** to secure the right contract for your needs.

 ## 4\. Engage Your Team

Simple actions like switching off unused appliances, closing doors to retain heat, and being mindful of lighting can make a real difference when practiced daily.

## 5\. Plan Ahead for Winter

Energy demand typically rises in colder months. By reviewing your usage now and locking in a competitive contract, you can avoid unnecessary price increases later in the season.

The clocks going back can signal higher **business energy costs**, but with the right approach, your company can stay efficient and save money. At Ecosave Gas & Power, we’ve helped over 50,000 UK businesses reduce their bills and cut the stress out of **switching energy suppliers**.
