# UK Energy Market Update: Stability Returns Ahead of Winter


## UK ENERGY MARKET OVERVIEW

After a period of turbulence, UK business energy markets saw a welcome return to stability this week. Gas prices dipped by over 2%, thanks to warmer weather forecasts easing short-term heating demand. Power costs also fell nearly 5% as clearer wind generation forecasts improved supply confidence. European gas reserves remain strong, with storage levels above 82% as winter nears, offering a solid buffer. National Grid confirmed a record £5 billion investment in H1 2026, aimed at reinforcing infrastructure and accelerating the shift to clean energy. Meanwhile, Shell’s Victory gas field in the North Sea has officially come online, contributing up to 150 million cubic feet per day and bolstering UK energy security alongside expanding renewables.
