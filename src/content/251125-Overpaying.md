# Why Is My Business Energy Bill So High? UK Overcharging Guide 2025

Most UK businesses assume their energy bill is accurate, but in 2025, thousands are unknowingly being overcharged every single month.

From incorrect meter readings to suppliers placing businesses on expensive out-of-contract rates, overcharging has quietly become one of the biggest complaints among SMEs.

Here’s the good news: almost all these issues can be fixed quickly, and in many cases, business owners can reclaim money they’ve overpaid.

At EcoSave Gas & Power, we help businesses uncover hidden overcharges and secure the lowest possible rates, so you never waste a penny more than you need to.


## Why Businesses Get Overcharged (Even When They Think Everything Is Fine)

### 1. Estimated Bills Instead of Accurate Meter Readings

Many suppliers still rely on estimated usage if a meter doesn’t automatically send readings, or if the business forgets to submit them.

This leads to:

· Paying for more energy than you used

· A bill that suddenly jumps for no reason

· A back-bill later when the supplier “corrects” the estimate

Smart meters aren’t perfect either — they often go offline, sending no readings at all.

Result: businesses overpay for months without realising.


### 2. Being Placed on Expensive ‘Out-of-Contract’ Rates

If your contract ends and you haven’t renegotiated, suppliers automatically move you onto out-of-contract or deemed rates.

These rates can be 3–5× more expensive than your contracted tariff.

Many business owners don’t even realise their contract expired — they simply see bills increasing and assume the market has changed.

EcoSave regularly finds companies paying thousands extra simply because their contract rolled over without them knowing.


### 3. Incorrect Meter Setup or Wrong Meter Type

This is more common than you’d think. Examples include:

· A business registered with the wrong meter type (e.g., day/night instead of standard)

· A supplier billing for the wrong meter entirely

· Old meters not matching the supplier’s database

· Multi-site businesses being billed for the wrong property

These errors often happen during supplier switches and can go unnoticed for months or even years.


### 4. Hidden Fees and Standing Charge Increases

Even when your unit rate seems reasonable, suppliers may:

· Increase standing charges

· Add admin fees

· Charge for late meter readings

· Apply “pass-through charges” without informing you

Over 80% of business owners never check these line-by-line changes on their bill.


### 5. Wrong Contract Type or Industry Category

If your business is categorised incorrectly, you might be charged a higher commercial rate than you should be.

For example:

· A small café charged as a high-demand commercial customer

· A salon paying the same standing charge as a factory

· A small office billed at an industrial rate

Incorrect categorisation = unnecessary overspending.


## Signs Your Business Is Being Overcharged

### Look out for these red flags:

· Your bill is higher but usage hasn’t changed

· Your meter reading and bill don’t match

· You’ve received estimated bills

· You missed a contract renewal email

· You recently changed suppliers

· You’re unsure when your contract actually ends

· Your bills vary massively month to month

Even one of these signs could mean you’re overpaying.
